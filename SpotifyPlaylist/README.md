# Day 46: Spotify Playlist Generator

Today I used my webscraping skills developed yesterday to create an application which scrapes songs from the Billboard Hot 100 for a user inputted year and uses Spotipy to generate a Spotify playlist of these songs. 

# Instructions

To use this application yourself you will need to replace the SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET variables with values of your own created from the spotify developer console. Then upon running the application you will be redirected to an example url. Input this url into the terminal response to authorize the application to access your spotify account and generate the playlist for you.
